\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}

In summary,

\begin{itemize}
	\item Theoretical foundations for reasoning about the expressive power of GNNS

	\item Tight bounds on the representational capacity of popular GNN variants. (cf. WL test)

	\item Designed a provably maximally powerful GNN under the neighborhood aggregation framework ({\it Graph Isomorphism Network})
	
\end{itemize}

\section{Future research}

Here are some possible directions for future research:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Different aggregators?
	\item Go beyond neighborhood aggregation
	\item Understand/improve the generalization properties of GNNs
	\item What if the node features are continuous (uncountable)?
	\item Better understanding of the optimization landscape
\end{itemize}
