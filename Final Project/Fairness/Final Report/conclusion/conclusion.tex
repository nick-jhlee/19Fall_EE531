\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}

In summary,

\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduction of fair clustering to classical clustering via fairlets

	\item Efficient approximation algorithms for finding fairlet decomposition

	\item Showed that fairness can introduce a computational bottleneck
\end{itemize}

\section{Future research}

Here are some possible directions for future research:


\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve the approximation ratio of the decomposition algorithms
	\item Give stronger hardness results
	\item Extend to the case where the protected class is not binary, but can take on multiple values
	\item Improve the running time \\
	(Down to nearly linear time! {\it Scalable Fair Clustering (ICML 2019)})
	\item New fairness constraint? \\
	(cf. {\it Proportionally Fair Clustering (ICML 2019)})
\end{itemize}
